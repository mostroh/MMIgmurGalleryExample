# MMImgurGalleryExample
This Android App pretends to be an example of how to manage the Imgur API applying Clean Architecture principles.
The purpose of this project is totally formative, for myself, and the main goal is using different technologies on an Android App.
The communication with the API is bassed in suggestions provided by Imgur for connecting and cosuming their services (https://apidocs.imgur.com/) The Clean Architecture Implementation is inspired by the aproach explained by Fernando Cejas in his blog (https://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/)
